# Trusted Insiders

#### Definition
The trusted insider, defined by ‘Countering the Insider Threat: A Guide for Australian Government’ an insider threat is considered an intentional or unintentional use of their legitimate access and privilege (Brew, 2016) to conduct activities that could cause harm including unauthorised use or disclosure of data, espionage, fraud and theft, sabotage among others (Australian Government Initiative, 2023). Motivations for the trusted insider may vary, but examples could include financial gain, revenge of a disgruntled employee, code of conduct, or moral discrepancies (Australian Government Initiative, 2023). The detection of a trusted insider threat is often challenging due to their legitimate access. Honeypots and honeynets may be used to alert organisations of insider threats due to their specific attack alerts and their ability to represent and draw in attackers or insiders with sensitive files that may be appealing e.g. honeyfiles. The behaviour of an insider threat actor may include excessive copying or modification of files, unauthorised use of data, unusual operating hours and system use and use of unauthorised networks like VPNs or file transfers (Australian Cyber Security Centre, 2023). 

Risks such threats hold to entities can be debilitating due to their unique access. ‘Countering the Insider Threat’ splits impacts of trusted insider threat actors into categories of human impact including victims of data breach fallout, security impact including national security reputation, reputational impact of the individual entity and personal involved, financial impact and Governmental systems and outcomes impact compromising the publics faith in Government policy and support (Australian Government Initiative, 2023). 

The Attorney General recommends highly that cyber awareness education and training, and a focus on embedded cyber security culture within organisations is the first and most important step in mitigating trusted insider threats (Brew, 2016).  
This role holds a unique threat due to the trust and knowledge of the insider of the inner workings of the organisation along with the legitimate access levels. The risk of an insider attack is a concern for every organisation due to its ability for high levels of damage in multiple areas e.g. financial impact and reputational impact previously discussed (Australian Government Initiative, 2023). With access to the inner workings and data of their organisation, the trusted insider can cause irreparable damage to an entity with fallout ranging far and wide if data breaches are involved (Brew, 2016). 

The unique threat stems from the trust in the employee, as one of the staff this employee has access to intimate systems and knowledge compared to an outside threat attacker who must get through considerable security boundaries to gain any access. These are difficult to detect and suspicious activity may go unnoticed for periods of time (Australian National Security, n.d.). 
A hyper-awareness of cyber security within an organisation is highly recommended as a first line of defence to mitigate the risk of trusted insider threat actor attacks (Brew, 2016). Staff training at all levels and integrated communication and involvement between security/IT teams and other staffing departments will create a fundamental security base and lower the risk of any insider threats (Brew, 2016). 
Suggested controls and mitigations that may be put in place should include the following: 
1. Secure and ongoing vetting of current and future employees. 
2. Security awareness and legal framework training for all members of staff. 
3. Regular security audits on internal and external attack surfaces. 
4. Analysis and strict permissions and access on both physical systems and digital systems. 
5. Appropriate reporting structures for the reporting of potential insider breaches along with appropriate response and investigation policies in place.
